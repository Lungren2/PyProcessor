## Current Limitations

- Limited to FFmpeg-supported formats and codecs
- No cloud integration or remote processing
- No plugin system for extending functionality
- No AI-assisted configuration
- No collaborative features
- No usage-based metering or analytics
- No distributed processing across machines
- No content-aware encoding optimization
- No visual workflow builder
- No real-time preview of encoding settings

## Technical Specifications

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.6+
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt5
- **Encoding Engine**: FFmpeg (external dependency)
- **Configuration Format**: JSON
- **Logging System**: Python's built-in logging module with custom handlers
- **Packaging**: PyInstaller with NSIS for Windows installer
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Documentation**: Markdown
- **Build System**: Custom scripts with Makefile support

## Performance Characteristics

- Parallel processing limited by CPU cores and memory
- Process isolation provides stability but increases memory usage
- File I/O can become a bottleneck with multiple parallel jobs
- GPU acceleration available through FFmpeg's hardware encoders
- Memory usage scales with the number of parallel jobs
- Large files may require significant temporary storage

## Security Considerations

- No built-in content encryption
- Server optimization scripts require administrative privileges
- No authentication system for accessing the application
- Configuration files stored as plain text
- No sandboxing for FFmpeg processes beyond basic process isolation
