# PyProcessor TODO System

This directory contains individual markdown files for each TODO item in the PyProcessor project. This system makes it easy to:

1. Track individual tasks with detailed information
2. Mark tasks as completed by simply removing their files
3. Organize tasks by category using file naming conventions

## File Naming Convention

Todo files follow this naming convention:

```
category_task-name.md
```

For example:
- `performance_gpu-resource-monitoring.md`
- `security_content-encryption.md`
- `core_cross-platform-path-handling.md`

## Categories

- `performance`: Performance and optimization tasks
- `security`: Security-related tasks
- `core`: Core architecture and functionality
- `cross-platform`: Cross-platform compatibility tasks
- `error-handling`: Error handling and recovery tasks
- `documentation`: Documentation tasks
- `testing`: Testing-related tasks

## Task File Structure

Each task file should include:

1. A descriptive title
2. A detailed description of the task
3. Acceptance criteria
4. Related files or components
5. Dependencies on other tasks (if any)
6. Priority level
7. Estimated effort

## Example Task File

```markdown
# Implement GPU Resource Monitoring

## Description
Add GPU resource monitoring capabilities to track and manage GPU usage when using hardware acceleration encoders like h264_nvenc and hevc_nvenc.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Detect available GPUs and their capabilities
- [ ] Monitor GPU memory usage during encoding
- [ ] Monitor GPU utilization percentage
- [ ] Implement throttling when GPU resources are constrained
- [ ] Add GPU metrics to the logging system

## Related Components
- `pyprocessor/utils/process/resource_manager.py`
- `pyprocessor/utils/process/resource_calculator.py`
- `pyprocessor/processing/encoder.py`

## Dependencies
- Resource monitoring system

## Priority
Medium

## Estimated Effort
Medium (3-5 days)
```

## Workflow

1. **Adding a new task**: Create a new markdown file in this directory following the naming convention and structure
2. **Completing a task**: Remove the file when the task is completed
3. **Updating a task**: Edit the file to update the task details or progress

This system provides a clean, file-based approach to task management that integrates well with version control systems.
