# Add Comprehensive Testing for Batch Processing

## Description
Implement comprehensive testing for the new batch processing system to ensure reliability and performance across different scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create unit tests for the ResourceCalculator class
- [ ] Implement integration tests for batch processing
- [ ] Add performance tests with different file sizes and counts
- [ ] Create stress tests for resource-constrained environments
- [ ] Implement cross-platform tests
- [ ] Add edge case tests (very large files, many small files)
- [ ] Create mock tests for resource monitoring
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Related Components
- `tests/` (new directory)
- `pyprocessor/utils/process/resource_calculator.py`
- `pyprocessor/processing/batch_processor.py`

## Dependencies
- Batch processing implementation (completed)

## Priority
High

## Estimated Effort
Medium (3-5 days)
