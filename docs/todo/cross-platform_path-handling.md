# Ensure Platform-Agnostic Path Handling

## Description
Ensure all path handling in the codebase is platform-agnostic, using forward slashes and environment variables instead of platform-specific path notations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit all path handling in the codebase
- [ ] Replace backslashes with forward slashes in all path strings
- [ ] Use Path objects from pathlib consistently
- [ ] Implement environment variable expansion in paths
- [ ] Create platform-specific path utilities when necessary
- [ ] Add path normalization functions
- [ ] Implement path validation and security checks
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for path handling across platforms
