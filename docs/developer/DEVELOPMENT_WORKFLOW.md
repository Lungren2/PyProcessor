# Development Workflow

This document outlines the recommended development workflow for contributing to the Video Processor project. Following these guidelines will help ensure a smooth development process and maintain code quality.

## Development Lifecycle

### 1. Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start development, make sure you have set up your environment correctly:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lungren2/PyProcessor.git
cd PyProcessor

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install development dependencies
pip install flake8 black isort mypy autoflake vulture
```

### 2. Creating a Feature Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
# Make sure you're on the main branch and up-to-date
git checkout main
git pull

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the changes you're making:

- `feature/new-feature-name` for new features
- `bugfix/issue-description` for bug fixes
- `docs/documentation-update` for documentation changes
- `refactor/component-name` for code refactoring

### 3. Making Changes

When making changes:

- Follow the [code style guidelines](CODE_STYLE.md)
- Keep changes focused on a single task
- Make regular commits with clear messages

#### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages that explain the purpose of the change:

```text
Short summary of changes (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation of the changes if needed. Wrap lines at
72 characters. Explain what and why, not how (the code shows that).

Fixes #123
```

### 4. Verifying Your Changes

Always verify your changes work as expected before submitting them.

Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality.

### 5. Code Quality Checks

Run code quality tools before submitting your changes:

```bash
# Format code with Black
black pyprocessor

# Sort imports
isort pyprocessor

# Run linting
flake8 pyprocessor

# Run type checking
mypy pyprocessor

# Remove unused imports and comment unused variables
python scripts/clean_code.py

# Or use the Makefile targets
make format     # Run Black formatter
make lint       # Run Flake8 linter
make clean-code # Remove unused imports and comment unused variables
```

### 6. Updating Documentation

Update documentation to reflect your changes:

- Update docstrings for any modified code
- Update relevant markdown files in the `docs/` directory
- For significant changes, update the README.md

### 7. Submitting a Pull Request

When you're ready to submit your changes:

```bash
# Push your branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click "Pull requests" and then "New pull request"
3. Select your branch as the compare branch
4. Click "Create pull request"
5. Fill in the pull request template with details about your changes
6. Reference any related issues

### 8. Code Review

After submitting a pull request:

- Respond to any feedback from code reviewers
- Make requested changes and push them to your branch
- The pull request will be updated automatically

### 9. Merging

Once your pull request is approved:

- It will be merged into the main branch
- Your branch can be deleted after merging

## Working with Issues

### Finding Issues to Work On

- Check the "Issues" tab on GitHub for open issues
- Look for issues labeled "good first issue" if you're new to the project
- Comment on an issue to express your interest in working on it

### Creating Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request:

1. Check if an issue already exists
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - A clear title
   - A detailed description
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs. actual behavior (for bugs)
   - Any relevant screenshots or logs

## Release Process

The release process is managed by project maintainers:

1. Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
2. Releases are created from the main branch
3. Release notes are generated from merged pull requests
4. New releases are published to PyPI

## Continuous Integration

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- Code quality checks are performed automatically

## Getting Help

If you need help with the development process:

- Check the documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Ask questions in the GitHub Discussions section
- Reach out to project maintainers

Remember that the goal is to maintain a high-quality codebase while making it easy for contributors to participate. Don't hesitate to ask for help if you're unsure about any part of the process.
