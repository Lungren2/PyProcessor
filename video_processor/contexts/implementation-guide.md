# Implementing Your Video Processor in Python 3
 
Here's how I'd approach implementing this script in Python, with expanded configuration options:
 
## Architecture Overview
 
I'd structure the application into these components:
 
1. **GUI Module** - Using either PyQt, Tkinter, or a web-based GUI
2. **FFmpeg Wrapper** - Handling all FFmpeg commands and processes
3. **File Management** - Handling file operations and folder organization
4. **Configuration Manager** - Managing user preferences and settings
5. **Processing Engine** - Orchestrating the parallel processing
 
## GUI Implementation
 
For a desktop application with extended configuration, PyQt would work well:
 
- **PyQt** offers more modern UI capabilities and better styling
 
The GUI would include:
- Input/output directory selection with file browser dialogs
- Encoder selection (libx265, h264_nvenc, libx264)
- Preset options (ultrafast, veryfast, medium)
- Tune options (zerolatency, film, animation)
- FPS selection dropdown
- Bitrate configuration for various resolutions
- Processing threads control (percentage of CPU cores)
- Job queue management interface
- Progress visualization for multiple files
 
## FFmpeg Integration
 
Instead of using direct command line calls, I'd use:
- **ffmpeg-python** library for cleaner, object-oriented control of FFmpeg
- **subprocess** as a fallback for more complex commands
 
Example pattern:
```
import ffmpeg
from pathlib import Path
 
def create_hls_stream(input_file, output_path, options):
    # Construct the ffmpeg operation using the ffmpeg-python builder pattern
    # Much cleaner than string-based command construction
```
 
## Concurrency Model
 
Python offers multiple approaches for parallel processing:
 
1. **ThreadPoolExecutor** - For I/O bound operations
2. **ProcessPoolExecutor** - For CPU-bound encoding operations
3. **asyncio** - For managing multiple async operations
 
I'd use ProcessPoolExecutor for the actual encoding:
```
with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_parallel_jobs) as executor:
    futures = {executor.submit(process_video, file, config): file for file in video_files}
    for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
        # Handle completion, update progress, etc.
```
 
## Configuration Management
 
For expanded configuration, I'd implement:
 
1. **User Preferences** - Stored in JSON or YAML files
2. **Profiles** - Saved encoding profiles for different use cases
3. **Dynamic Configuration** - Runtime configuration changes
4. **Smart Defaults** - System-aware configuration (detecting GPU, CPU cores)
 
## Project Structure

```

## Implementation Approach
 
1. Start with a basic command-line version to test the FFmpeg integration
2. Build the core processing engine with proper parallelism 
3. Add the GUI as a layer on top of the processing engine
4. Implement configuration management and profiles
5. Add extended features and optimizations
 
This approach would give you a more maintainable, expandable, and cross-platform solution compared to the PowerShell script, with better opportunities for adding more sophisticated features in the future.
